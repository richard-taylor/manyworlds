# manyworlds

This is a project inspired by Max Tegmark's book *Our Mathematical Universe* and Justina Robson's sci-fi series *Quantum Gravity*.

The implementation here is Python 3, but should be considered only a reference implementation of the protocols to be used between peers.

Can a network of peers *communicate effectively* without any central control? Can mass *cheating* be avoided, or mitigated, when no one can be trusted absolutely?

What is *trust* online anyway? Is trust a measure of the amount of information two parties have shared? Most people trust their family most because they have known them a long time. People trust friends they met face-to-face because just seeing someone is exchanging a lot of information.

Internet systems normally force you to make binary choices about trust. It is all or nothing. That isn't how the real world works. Can we do better and introduce degrees of trust that are automatically created and monitored for us?
