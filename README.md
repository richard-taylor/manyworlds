# manyworlds

This is a project inspired by Max Tegmark's book *Our Mathematical Universe* and Justina Robson's sci-fi series *Quantum Gravity*.

The implementation here is Python 3, but should be considered only a reference implementation of the protocols to be used between clients and servers; and between servers and other servers.

Can a network of clients and servers form a fun *game* without any central control? Can mass *cheating* be avoided, or mitigated, when no one server can be trusted absolutely?
